# Urban Sound Recognition system

Data Mining and Machine Learning Project

The goal of this project is to obtain a classifier that can automatically classify environmental sounds according to their category.
This can be implemented on both transport vehicles and wearable devices to improve road safety.
The classification part uses a machine learning algorithm to classify the correct category, selecting it from the most frequent categories.
